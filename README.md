osrm-backend-uml
================

This is a non-official UML retro-analysis of [Project-OSRM/osrm-backend](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend). It was intended to be a guide for development. Unfortunately, the result isn't quite good. We release it in hope that it may be useful for someone.

### Tools

Built with [PlantUML](http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/).

1. Download PlantUML Jar.
2. Open a shell and run PlantUML with class-diagram.puml (the main file) as parameter. Command should look like this : `java -jar plantuml.jar class-diagram.puml`
3. If references are broken, change it in the main file.

You can also use Netbeans with the PlantUML plugin to have a better coding experience.
